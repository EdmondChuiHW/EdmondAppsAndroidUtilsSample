EdmondAppsAndroidUtilsSample
============================

Sample app to demonstrate [EdmondAppsAndroidUtils] [1] with logging, Activities, Fragments, SQLite databases, asynchronous operations, JSON, animations and more..  
  
Why is this app about US presidents? Because I searched "list of" on Google and it returned [this Wiki page] [2].  
  
[Link to Play Store] [3].
